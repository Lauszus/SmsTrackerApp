This is an Android app intended to be used with a Weather balloon, RC plane or similar.

When it receives a SMS with the time and coordinates like so:

```
hr:min:sec,lat,lng
```

It will automatically add a marker on a map showing you the location.

## How to build

This project is intended to be used with Android Studio and Gradle. See the following page for more information: <http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html>.

You will also have to create a xml file containing the Google Maps API key and the phone number. See the following link for more information: <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/intro#sample_code>.
