This is an Android app intended to be used with a Weather ballon.

## How to build
To build this application you need to include google-play-services_lib as a [library project](http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject). See the following link for more information: <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/intro#sample_code>.

You will also have to create a xml file containing the Google Maps API key and the phone number.
